# Hi, I'm Huayun Ai! 👋  
### Software Developer | C & C++ Enthusiast | Problem Solver  

🚀 Transitioning from international business to software development, I specialize in C and C++ with a strong focus on backend systems, algorithms, and memory optimization. Currently honing my skills at **42 Berlin**, I thrive on solving complex problems and writing efficient, low-level code.

## 🔹 What I Do  
💻 **Systems & Backend Development** – Crafting optimized, low-level C/C++ programs.  
🔎 **Algorithms & Data Structures** – Implementing efficient solutions to computational problems.  
🐧 **Unix/Linux Programming** – System calls, process management, and shell scripting.

## 🔹 My Journey  
My career began in international sales, where I managed B2C operations, built global partnerships, and optimized supply chains. This experience shaped my problem-solving mindset, which I now apply to software engineering—writing structured code, debugging complex systems, and optimizing performance.
